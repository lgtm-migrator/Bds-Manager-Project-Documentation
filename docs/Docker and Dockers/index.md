# The Docker!

We offer several methods to run the Bds Manager, from a single binary to a Docker Image to just doing what it's supposed to do.

We are always improving and we always bring a new feature or fix and there will always be a new version.

Lately we have (as of this writing) only one fully functioning docker image for amd64 and arm64 architectures. we always want everything to run simply on everything that's a platform.

We are looking for a simple way to bring it to Kubernetes.
