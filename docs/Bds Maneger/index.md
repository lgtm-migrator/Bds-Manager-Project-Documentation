# From a local interface to universal remote access in your browser

Before we had a problem with Bds Maneger (Electron) everything was locally and could not be accessed remotely like your browser, and this greatly limited the potential that the Bds Maneger Core has as a backend, the Bds Maneger (Electron) was archived by default maintenance (and by consuming ram), and a new project was created with the same name as the previous one.

Currently Bds Maneger (Express) is under regular maintenance and maintains the update process along with Bds Maneger Core.
