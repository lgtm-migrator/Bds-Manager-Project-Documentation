# System Support

## MacOS Arm64

We haven't had a test form yet, and anyone with a MacOS M1 machine (Anyone can collaborate with the tests), can open a branch with any commit for the tests.

## MacOS All

For Minecraft Bedrock, use Docker as it comes with the tools, and is ready for any platform on AMD_64 (x86_64), as Mojang Studios has not yet made the files available for MacOS.

## Respberry PI

The Raspberry PI has partial support for Bedrock, this was resolved with the Docker image.

Aarch64 PI:

- **PI 2, rev: ^1.2**
