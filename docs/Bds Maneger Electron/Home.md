# Why did this project come about?

This project came about when FoxyNoTail made a manager for Windows, but not for Linux. And at that moment I had the penguin on my computer, so I decided to bring an application to Linux

 With some questions about what technology would be used, it would be a program in Qt, gtk or NodeJs + electron. And who ended up guiding me to my knowledge was nodejs + electron.

A version for Linux ended up leaving more to the side to redo the javascript because everything was a child_process with a tool already installed on the system (Bds-Maneger-CLI). At this very moment, I know almost nothing about javascript, so I ended up giving a nice read at w3school and the documentation of electron and NodeJs. The current javascript is to have as little child_process as possible and to be totally a unified javascript to be implemented in several pages in a quick, simple and easy to maintain.

Html5 plus the power of javascript can bring total changes and implementations of content on the pages, in addition to the large modules of NodeJs we can bring more power and simplicity to the project.
