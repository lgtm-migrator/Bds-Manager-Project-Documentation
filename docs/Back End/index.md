## A little heart of the manager

Like every project, we need a way to get something from a main server to send a telemetry or even report bugs to the devs.

But this little heart only provides a small set of something like a temporary Host to connect to the server in a simple way. we're still making a simple way to send telemetry without stealing information that can be worth gold to your Player/User.
