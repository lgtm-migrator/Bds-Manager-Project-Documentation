# Who said we can't play

Thanks to several open source projects, we can make several Minecraft Bedrock players play with Java players ([Geyser "*The only thing we need is java if you want to use Geyser*"](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser)) or even make a Minecraft Bedrock player for consoles (Xbox and Playstattion) to be able to play with some `unofficial` [Phantom server](https://github.com/jhead/phantom).
