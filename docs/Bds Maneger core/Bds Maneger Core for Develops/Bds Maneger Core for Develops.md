# For Develops

If you are starting a project based on Bsd Manager Core we have a quick start guide.

## Prerequisites

* Git
* NodeJS 14+
* Github Account

## Let's go then!

1. Start an empty repository With an Excellent Name for your Project like `this is very simple` in Github to start your new Project. and clone it somewhere easy to start.

2. With a text editor of your choice open your repository to start installing the dependencies and start your project. with the command `npm init -y`

3. Now let's install Bds Maneger Core with the command `npm i @the-bds-maneger/core`.

4. Now let's create a file that we can call `index.js` and inside it we will put the following lines to import the Bds Maneger Core:

```javascript
// Import the bds maneger core to index.js
const BdsManeger = require("@the-bds-maneger/core");
```

5. Now that we've imported the Bds Manager Core you can start making your modifications. Be creative. Right here we have functions to create an Excellent Program for Your project.
