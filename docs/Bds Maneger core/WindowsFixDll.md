# Windows (Server) Core

Windows Core does not come with some dlls that make Bedrock and other servers unable to start the server.

Download the following files:

- C++ 
    - [Microsoft Visual Studio C++][msc++]

- Independent DLLs

    * These dlls should be placed inside the `C:\Windows\System32` folder
    * If it doesn't work, create an issue or a discursion in the [The Bds Maneger Core](https://github.com/The-Bds-Maneger/Bds-Maneger-Core) repository
